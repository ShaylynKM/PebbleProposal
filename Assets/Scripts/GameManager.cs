/// Hello, everyone! There should be a GameManager class in every game that you make and one that is in every level you make. The GameManager is needed to glue everything together, so I have addded one here to say to you all to start one on the main branch. Please, please, have a GameManager that you add to a GameManager class.
/// 
/// I would like at least a few levels, and one thing that I want is to get results at the end of each level for what you got from the game. You should also have the ability to go back to levels you have played previous; I do not expect to have something like an overworld, but I would like the ability to go back to levels you have beat from a menu system. Make sure that you can not go to levels you have not been to so far. 
/// Your game manager should be keeping track of things like lives, collectables, etc. Look into persistence I mentioned in MenuThings for more information.
